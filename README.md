# P5-Design-of-a-cracksealing-parallel-robot

This github repository contains the scripts and codes used to develop the design and control of the prototype of a cracksealing parallel robot.

All livescripts (.mlx files) from matlab are converted into readable .md files. The code should nonetheless be executeable in matlab with the right toolboxes applied.

Twincat files from the Implementation folder should be run in twincat, and are not necessarily executable in other IDE's.
